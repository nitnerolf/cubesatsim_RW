# cubesatsim_RW
An addon for the [cubesatsim](https://github.com/alanbjohnston/CubeSatSim/wiki), enabling attitude control!

You will find here stl and openscad files to print a 2U cubesat structure, with a convenient hinge system to pop it open for demos.

I also plan to publish the reaction wheel assembly soon!
